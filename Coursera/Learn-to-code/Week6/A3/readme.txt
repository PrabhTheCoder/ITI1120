This archive contains three files:
1. random_board_generator.py, a Python module
2. Cornell_Letter_Frequency.txt, a comma-separated list generated from this online list of frequencies of English words:
https://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html
3. mieliestronk_word_list.txt, one of many available online lists of English words, this one chosen because it's length of approximately 58,00 words seemed convenient.  Downloaded from here:
http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html

This module is designed for use with the "Word Search" game, assignment 3 of Coursera's "Learn to Program: The Fundamentals by University of Toronto" (but is not endorsed by anyone other than myself.)

Simply copy the three files into the directory where you have the a3.py module.  You can then run the module 'random_board_generator.py', and it will generate a board of random letters while maintaining the relative letter frequency of English.  It will present a familiar dialogue for saving the board.  The default size is 10 x 10, but you can adjust this in the module (after the 'if __main__' statement.

Use the 'mieliestronk_word_list.txt' as your word list when asked to select one.
